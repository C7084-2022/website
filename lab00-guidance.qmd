## Best practice advice for labs

There are several recommendations you should follow to get the most out of these exercises and this module as a whole.

-   **Set up a separate script for each lab** (e.g. an R script) to organize and document your work

-   **Answer each question formally** and fully

-   **Use a fully commented, reproducible script style** with a Header, Contents, and clickable Section blocks. This will help you practice Best Practice (see what I did there?), and will make the script useful to yourself in the future as a reference (e.g., the next time you want to set up a K means analysis script...)

-   **Type 100% of your own code:** do not copy and paste anything (practice, practice + troubleshooting error messages for typos and other issues)

-   Consider writing your lab scripts using **R Markdown**

-   Consider setting up a **Github repository** for your lab scripts
